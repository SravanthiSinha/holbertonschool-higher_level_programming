# High Level Python Programming
This repository contains projects for training in the high-level track at [Holberton School](https://holbertonschool.com). The projects are in Python 3.4.3 / JavaScript / Swift / HTML / Ruby and are designed to learn at a beginners level.

## Styling and Specifications
All programs were written from Bash, using emacs.
### Compilation
The python programs must run with pyton 3.4.3 on Ubuntu 14.04, and pass all style checks with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

All scripts should have execution permissions:
```
chmod u+x file
```
To Run the scripts:
```
python3 file.py
./file.sh
```
To check the styling:
```
pep8 file.py
```
### Directories
Each directory is named after a concept and contains ordered exercises from mandatory to advance level, and a README.md with a short description of its files.
