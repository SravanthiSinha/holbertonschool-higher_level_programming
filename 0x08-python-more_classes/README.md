# Rectangle Class its attributes and methods.

* Private instance attribute: width:
        * property def width(self): to retrieve it
        * property setter def width(self, value): to set it:
                * width must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message width must be an integer
                * if width is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message width must be >= 0
* Private instance attribute: height:
        * property def height(self): to retrieve it
        * property setter def height(self, value): to set it:
                * height must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message height must be an integer
                * if height is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message height must be >= 0
* Public class attribute number_of_instances:
        * Initialized to 0
        * Incremented during each new instance instantiation
        * Decremented during each instance deletion
* Public class attribute print_symbol:
        * Initialized to #
        * Used as symbol for string representation
        * Can be any type
* Instantiation with optional width and height: def __init__(self, width=0, height=0):
* Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the rectangle area
* Public instance method: def perimeter(self): that returns the rectangle perimeter:
        * if width or height is equal to 0, perimeter has to be equal to 0
* print() and str() should print the rectangle with the character #:
        * if width or height is equal to 0, return an empty string
* repr() should return a string representation of the rectangle to be able to recreate a new instance by using eval()
* Print the message "Bye rectangle..." when an instance of Rectangle is deleted
* Static method def bigger_or_equal(rect_1, rect_2): that returns the biggest rectangle based on the area
        * rect_1 must be an instance of Rectangle, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message rect_1 must be an instance of Rectangle
        * rect_2 must be an instance of Rectangle, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message rect_2 must be an instance of Rectangle
        * Returns rect_1 if both have the same area value
* Class method def square(cls, size=0): that returns a new Rectangle instance with width == height == size
