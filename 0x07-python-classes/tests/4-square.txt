 How to Use 4-square.py
===============================

The Square class is very basic one.
One can set the size of the square and compute the area of the square.
There are absic validations as size to be an non-negative integer.

Creating Square instance
========================
::
        >>> Square = __import__('4-square').Square
        >>> my_square = Square(10)
        >>> print(my_square.size)
        10

Numbers
=======
::
        >>> my_square.size = 2
        >>> print(my_square.size)
        2

Non-Numbers
===========
::
        >>> my_square.size = 2.3
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: size must be an integer
        >>> my_square.size = 'a'
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: size must be an integer
        >>> my_square.size = -1
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: size must be >= 0

Computing Area
==============
::
        >>> print(my_square.size)
        2
        >>> my_square.area()
        4
